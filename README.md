This is the repository for the development of [wrldchan.org](https://www.wrldchan.org). 

The website is similar to Reddit with its nested reply structure. I also try to keep every user anonymous, but also recognizable in each post. Therefore, each user will have a unique username in each post. However, that username changes if they reply in a different post. 
Currently, the website is experiencing some issues with bots creating posts, but I am too busy at the moment to fix that. 

Feel free to try out the website yourself! Hope you'll enjoy it :)
